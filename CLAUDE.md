# E184 x NeuroNYC Workshop Landing Page (Single Page)

You are helping me design and build a refined, single-page event website used for speaker/attendee context and RSVP coordination.

## Event facts (do not change)
- Date: March 26
- Time: 5:00–9:00 PM
- Location: Brown Rudnick (New York City) — venue partner providing space
- Hosted by: NeuroNYC and e184
- Format: invite-only

## Primary goal
Make the event immediately legible and compelling in under 60 seconds (high-signal, not hypey), and provide all essentials in one place.

## IA / section order (single page with anchor nav)
Navigation is anchored sections (one URL), not multiple pages.

1) Hero
   - Title (workshop name)
   - One-line framing (what it is / who it convenes)
   - Date + time + location (Brown Rudnick, NYC)
   - Primary CTA button (text: "Request an invite" or "RSVP" — link [TBD])
2) About
   - A short paragraph (3–5 sentences) explaining the purpose:
     - convene researchers across disciplines around brain foundation models / NeuroAI
     - unique perspectives + open questions
     - panels + substantial room for conversation
3) Program at a glance
   - Simple schedule block (high level; exact times can be approximate or [TBD]):
     - Welcome
     - Keynote [TBD]
     - Panel 1
     - Panel 2
     - Reception / informal discussion
4) Speakers
   - "Speakers to be announced" (leave space to add headshots later)
5) Partners / Hosts
   - Logo row + one-line roles:
     - e184 (host)
     - NeuroNYC (host)
     - Brown Rudnick (venue partner)
6) Practicalities
   - Invite-only
   - Any note about the tone/aim (high-signal convening)
   - Optional "outcome" line (placeholder if not finalized): "We hope this convening helps begin to chart a course for [TBD]."
7) Contact
   - One email line for inquiries ([TBD])

## Visual direction
- Refined, airy, ethereal light-blue background (subtle gradients; no literal clouds).
- Clean typography, lots of whitespace, minimal UI chrome.
- Near-black text; one deep navy/slate accent for CTA and links.
- Mobile-first, accessible (semantic HTML, good contrast, focus states).

## Build constraints
- Prefer a static site: index.html + styles.css (+ optional small script.js only if needed).
- Minimal dependencies; no frameworks unless I explicitly ask.
- Do not invent details. Use [TBD] placeholders for missing info (CTA link, contact email, keynote/panel titles).
